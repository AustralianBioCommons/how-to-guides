{% include callout.html type="note" content="FAQ: can data be seamlessly transferred from the Data Portal to Galaxy Australia?
Australian BioCommons is working with the Bioplatforms Australia data portal team to develop a direct transfer mechanism from the portal to Galaxy Australia histories. 
This solution will be made available as soon as possible." %}

## 1. Select your data 

### Using the [Bioplatforms Australia Data Portal](https://data.bioplatforms.com/)
- The files you need for the assembly are ```.css.bam``` format
- Fig 1 shows a HiFi data set selected in the data portal browser interface.

## 2. Click ```Access``` and select ```Copy Download URL``` in the drop down menu (see Fig. 1)

This will copy a download URL to your clipboard.

{% include callout.html type="warning" content="The URL is time sensitive and will expire after 10 minutes." %}

You only need to instigate the download (next step) within this 10 minute window, the import itself can take longer than 10 minutes.

## 3. In Galaxy Australia, perform the steps outlined in Fig. 2

1. Click on ```Upload Data``` 
2. Select ```Paste/Fetch data```
3. Paste the URL you obtained from the data portal into the content box.
4. Select ```Start```

{% include callout.html type="note" content="You can paste multiple URLs in this box. If you have more than 1 SMRT cell of data, you will need to copy the URLs for each of the ```ccs.bam``` files and paste them in here." %}

## Other options

### Self-managed (download & upload)

1. [Download](https://usersupport.bioplatforms.com/programmatic_access.html) the required HiFi data to your personal computer
2. Upload / transfer to Galaxy Australia (see **Fig 3**)
     - Note: [This Galaxy Training Network tutorial describes how to upload files via URL](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.html#upload-a-file). The same mechanism can be used to upload local files, by selecting ```Choose local files``` (see **Fig 3**).
