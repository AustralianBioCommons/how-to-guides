**Do you want your tools and workflows to be documented in a standard way?**

**If the answer is yes, then read on!**

## Why do the [documentation guidelines](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines) exist?

The Australian BioCommons has been working with community bioinformaticians and our infrastructure partners to establish a guidelines repository that can act as a template for documentation of tools and workflows.

The repository aims to provide guidance and a minimal starting template for:

- Documenting a new [tool](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/tools.md) or [workflow](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/workflows.md)
- Documenting tool or workflow access, use and [optimisation on infrastructures](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/infrastructure_optimisation.md)
- Recommending additional repository contents that make your work more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

>The Australian BioCommons guidelines are based on learnings from existing efforts, including our own projects, but also the Galaxy, NextFlow and Snakemake communities.

## Should I contribute to an existing community workflow effort instead?

The [BioCommons guideline](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines) is based on learnings from multiple community efforts including the Galaxy [Intergalactic Workflow Commission (IWC)](https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc), [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) and [Snakemake](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows).

If you are using Galaxy, Nextflow or Snakemake workflow languages and would like to contribute to their community workflow efforts, **you could be using their specific guidelines**, which are linked to below.

## Is there a way to let people know how my repository should be cited?

The [documentation guidelines](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines) include a `CITATION.cff` file to highlight 
how the repository and its contents should be cited.
